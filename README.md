## INTRODUCTION :
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a simple assembler developed in C++. 
The assembler is designed to translate assembly language code into machine code for a specific architecture.
It contains one main file, i.e., code.cpp. It includes file handling and handles the input of assembly code. This file includes all other six header files, 
which were made separately.
This assembler supports six different instruction formats: I, R, S, SB, J, and UJ.

## Instruction Formats
- I: Immediate instructions.
- R: Register instructions.
- S: Store instructions.
- SB: Branch instructions with signed offset.
- J: Jump instructions.
- UJ: Jump instructions with immediate values.
  ## LANGUAGE USED - C++.
  
  ## Usage
To use the assembler:
1. Firstly, you need to run the `code.cpp` file. Make sure to include all six header files (`I.h`, `S.h`, `U.h`, `SB.h`, `J.h`, `R.h`) and the text file containing      assembly code (`assembly_code.asm`) in the folder where `code.cpp` is located.
2. Write your assembly language code in a text file named `assembly_code.asm`.
3. Compile and execute the assembler program.
4. Provide the path to your assembly code (`assembly_code.asm`) as input to the assembler.
5. The assembler will generate the corresponding machine code, typically outputting it to another file named as `ans.mc`.
6. Hence,The code in 'ans.mc' will be your desired output for assembly code.
   
## Verification
To verify your machine code , you can use "Venus Simulator" and match it with the machine code generated by simulator. It should be matched with the code       
generated in'ans.mc' file.
## Assumption
1)The .data: attribute should end with a colon.(Ex-.data is not acceptable but .data: is acceptable)
2)The .text: attribute should end with a colon.
3)Label should be in different line than instruction.
4)Comment should also be in separate line than instruction.
