# CS204-PROJECT
INTRODUCTION :
This Repository contains the source code and documentation for a simple assembler developed in C++.
The Assembler is designed to translate assembly language code into machine code for a specific architecture.
This assembler supports six different instruction formats: I, R, S, SB, J, and UJ.

## Instruction Formats
- I: Immediate instructions.
- R: Register instructions.
- S: Store instructions.
- SB: Branch instructions with signed offset.
- J: Jump instructions.
- UJ: Jump instructions with immediate values.
  ## Usage
To use the assembler:
1. Write your assembly language code in a text file (`assembly_code.asm`).
2. Run the assembler executable, providing the path to your assembly code as input.
3. The assembler will generate the corresponding machine code, typically outputting it to another file .
